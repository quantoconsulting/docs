## Overview

Stock provides a comprehensive game integration API that allows third-party vendors to seamlessly integrate our games into their websites. This documentation outlines the simple integration process for accessing and displaying our games through iframe embedding.

## Getting Started

To integrate Stock games into your platform, you'll need:

- A base URL provided by Stock
- An authorization token for API access

## Authentication

All API requests must include an authorization token in the request headers. This token will be manually provided by Stock during the onboarding process.

```
Headers:
api-key: YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN
```

## Game Integration Flow

### Step 1: Request Game URL

To access any game, make a POST request to the external user endpoint:

**Endpoint:** `{BASE_URL}/api/external-user/`

**Method:** POST

**Headers:**

```
api-key: YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body:**

```
const payload = {
  gameName,    // Game identifier (see available games below)
  name,        // Player's display name
  userId,      // Unique user identifier from your system
};
```

### Step 2: Receive Game URL

**Response:**

```
{
  "url": "https://game-url-here.com"
}
```

### Step 3: Embed Game

Use the returned URL to embed the game in your frontend as an iframe:

```
<iframe 
  src="RECEIVED_GAME_URL" 
  width="100%" 
  height="600px"
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

## Security Considerations

- Ensure HTTPS is used for all API communications
